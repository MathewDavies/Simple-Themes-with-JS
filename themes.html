        <p>This is a demonstration of how we can create themes using a selection box and some Javascript. The theme works by settings
            the data attribute in css using javascript to take the value from the drop down menu.

        <p>
            I tend to be a little paranoid about compatibility so I appreciate that I use two things that aren't universally supported 
            - the data attribute and the color variable. On <a href = "https://caniuse.com/"> caniuse.com </a> both attributes have 
            around 98% support. I have put a default theme of light, although this still relies on css variables. 
        </p>

            The next logical step for this project would be to store user's preference and load the selected theme on the next visit. This could 
            be done in several ways depending on the project. If the site doesn't have a login, using a cookie could be the easiest way to do this.
            If the website is based on a login, then they will most likely have a database attached and session variables will be loaded into
             each page. You could use one of these session variables to load the theme.
