# Simple-Themes-with-JS
Using Javascript and CSS variables to create a simple theme on a website

Functionality:
This is a simple demonstration of how you can apply themes using css variables and a few lines of javascript. Use the drop down menu on the website to select which theme you want. Once selected, the page will change color - yes, its a theme.

How its done:

- We set the html tag in css to have several different color schemes depending on the data attribute set to it
- We use color variables to cascade the changes down the spreadsheet
- We use an event listener in Javascript to listen for when the theme drop down box is changed.
- This dropdown box sets off a Javascript function that changes the data attribute of our html tag in css
- When the data attribute changes, the color scheme in CSS that is accessed also changes, changing the appearance of the page
- We also added a transition function that makes the transition between themes smooth
